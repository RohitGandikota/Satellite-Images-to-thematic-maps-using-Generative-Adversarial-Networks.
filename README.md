# Satellite-Images-to-thematic-maps-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.
In this work, we generate the thematic maps from satellite images. Here, we generate water bodies thematic and use both traditional Autoencoder and a Generative Adversarial Network (M2TGAN). We used the open street maps to collect the sentinal satellite's data using script. 
In Train1.py, we train a conventional Autoencoder that takes a tile of satellite imagery and outputs the water bodies in the data. In M2TbaseGAN.py, we train an Adversarial Network with custom loss functions suitable for thematic map generation. We use SSIM as a loss function as satellite images has lot of textural information that can preserved by considering SSIM as an objective function. To make the GAN training stable, we also use base learning technique where the satellite image is first converted to a simpler latent space and then is passed through the M2TGAN to generate water thematic maps. 

The script to downlaod the open street maps data and tiling of the huge sized satellite images are provided in the repository along with the training codes. We used Keras GPU to train our models.
